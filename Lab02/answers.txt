Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

When create a constructor like that, Eclipse will give a warning about the duplicate constructor. If we ignore the warning and continue to create the constructor, then JAVA will give an error. This is because 2 constructors have no difference about type or number of arguments.
